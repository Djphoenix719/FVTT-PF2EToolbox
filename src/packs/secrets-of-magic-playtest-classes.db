user-select: text; color: #191813;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ancestry and Background</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background, as described in Chapter 2.<br /></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Eidolon</h2>\n<p>You have a connection with a powerful and otherworldly entity called an eidolon, and you can use your life force as a conduit to manifest the eidolon into the mortal world. An eidolon is a being formed of ephemeral essences&mdash;typically mind, life, or spirit&mdash;that needs your body and connection to this world to manifest.</p>\n<p>Choose what type of eidolon you have from the options beginning on page 18. In this playtest, the options available (and the spellcasting tradition each option grants you) are angel (divine), beast (primal), devotion phantom (occult), and dragon (arcane). When you choose your eidolon, you also determine their appearance and general form within the parameters for that particular type of eidolon. Once you establish your eidolon&rsquo;s type and general appearance, these features can&rsquo;t later be changed.</p>\n<p>The link between you and your eidolon takes the form of a magic glowing sigil on each of your bodies. This symbol can&rsquo;t be obscured either magically or via mundane means, as it either shines through the magic or appears over top of whatever you use to cover it. This sigil, combined with the way that the two of you clearly act in tandem, makes it readily apparent to an intelligent observer that the two of you have some connection with each other, even if that onlooker doesn&rsquo;t know what a summoner or an eidolon is.</p>\n<p>Your eidolon is no mere minion; the two of you share the same life force and work together as equals. You and your eidolon share your actions, your Hit Points, and your multiple attack penalty. Each round, you can use any of your actions and reaction for yourself or your eidolon. Damage taken by either you or the eidolon reduces your Hit Points, while healing either of you restores your Hit Points. If you or your eidolon is affected by anything that would change a creature&rsquo;s actions, it affects your shared actions. In any case, if you are both subject to the same effect, you take the effects only once (applying the worse effect, if applicable).</p>\n<p>For instance, if you and your eidolon are caught in an area effect that would heal or damage you both, only the greater amount of healing or damage applies. Similarly, if you or your eidolon is slowed, you would start your turn with fewer actions, but even if you were both slowed, it wouldn&rsquo;t increase the effect. However, if you were slowed 1 and your eidolon slowed 2, you&rsquo;d have 2 fewer actions because that&rsquo;s the more severe effect.</p>\n<p>This life link doubles as a conduit that allows you to manifest your eidolon in this world. You gain the Manifest Eidolon activity, allowing you to make your eidolon appear at your side.</p>\n<p>Your eidolon doesn&rsquo;t have the summoned or minion trait, but the conduit that allows them to manifest is also a tether between you. They must remain within 100 feet of you at all times and can&rsquo;t willingly go beyond that limit. If forced beyond this distance, or if you&rsquo;re reduced to 0 Hit Points, your eidolon&rsquo;s physical form dissolves, and you need to use Manifest Eidolon to manifest them again.</p>\n<p>Your connection also allows you to communicate with your eidolon telepathically at all times, even when they aren&rsquo;t manifested. This ability lets you coordinate your actions with your eidolon to accomplish more than either of you could alone. You gain the Act Together and Share Senses actions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While your eidolon can&rsquo;t wear or use magic items except for companion items that specifically mention that they work for eidolons, their connection to you means they benefit from certain items once you invest in those items. Your eidolon gains item bonuses to Perception and skills from any magical items you&rsquo;ve invested, as well as the benefits of the potency and resilient runes on your armor or the item bonuses of any <em>bracers of armor</em> you&rsquo;ve invested. Your eidolon benefits from the <em>potency</em>, <em>striking</em>, and property runes on your <em>handwraps of mighty blows</em>, and you can Invest a single magic weapon to share the benefits of those runes from the weapon as well, even though you normally can&rsquo;t Invest a magic weapon.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Summoner Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>Your connection to your eidolon grants you limited magic, which is connected to your eidolon&rsquo;s nature. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell and five cantrips. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a summoner, the magical link with your eidolon grants you additional, more powerful spell slots. Your total number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast are shown on Table 2&ndash;2: Summoner Spells per Day. Because you draw magic from your connection to your eidolon, you have no more than two spell slots of your highest level and, if you can cast 2nd-level spells or higher, two spell slots of 1 level lower than your highest spell level.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 447 of the Core Rulebook.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell&rsquo;s level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn&rsquo;t use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up&mdash;this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a sorcerer. For example, as a 1st-level summoner, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level summoner, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Spell Repertoire</strong></h3>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells and five cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your eidolon, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Each time you gain a level, you can reselect the spells in your repertoire.</p>\n<p>At 3rd level, your repertoire grows to four spells of your choice of any spell level you can cast, though you must always know at least one spell you can cast using your lower-level slots.&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

Conduit spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to specifically connect with your eidolon, such as by having a heart-to-heart conversation, playing together, or meditating together on the nature of your bond.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don&rsquo;t require spell slots, and you can&rsquo;t cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells appear on page 300 of the Core Rulebook.</p>\n<p>You learn the evolution surge conduit spell (page 24), which grants your eidolon one of several useful benefits in combat.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Conduit Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Conduit cantrips are special conduit spells that don&rsquo;t cost Focus Points, so you can cast them as often as you like. Conduit cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose from your tradition&rsquo;s spell list. Generally, only feats can give you more conduit cantrips. Unlike other cantrips, you can&rsquo;t swap out conduit cantrips gained from summoner feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining (Core Rulebook 481).</p>\n<p>You learn the boost eidolon conduit cantrip (page 24), which briefly boosts your eidolon&rsquo;s capabilities.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat.

For the purpose of this playtest, we&rsquo;re testing one type of eidolon for each tradition: the dragon eidolon for arcane, the angel eidolon for divine, the devotion phantom eidolon for occult, and the beast eidolon for primal.</p>\n<p>Arcane eidolons are usually formed of mental essence, also known as astral essence. They include dragon eidolons, the astral echoes of ancient dragons; construct eidolons, astral beings formed into a simple construct shape through arcane magic; and amalgam eidolons, scientifically crafted magical experiments built carefully out of astral thoughtforms.</p>\n<p>Divine eidolons are always formed of spiritual essence, much like the divine servitors they resemble. They include representatives of the many families of divine servitors, such as angels, demons, and psychopomps.</p>\n<p>Occult eidolons are also usually formed of spiritual essence, though they often have a more ectoplasmic consistency than divine eidolons. Occult eidolons usually result from a spirit unwilling or unable to pass on, instead taking refuge with a summoner to avoid becoming undead; these types of eidolons are known as phantoms. A few are far stranger beings from beyond mortal comprehension. Regardless of their nature, each occult eidolon has a connection to a particular emotion.</p>\n<p>Primal eidolons are usually formed of life essence. They take the forms of the creatures of the natural world, such as beasts, plants, or fey, though sometimes in unusual combinations. Less common but no less mighty are elemental eidolons, formed of the material essence of elemental matter.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Proficiencies</strong></h3>\n<p>Your eidolon&rsquo;s level is equal to yours. They begin as an expert in Fortitude and Will saves and are trained in Reflex saves. In addition, they&rsquo;re trained in unarmed attacks and unarmored defense. They share your skill proficiencies. Certain class features increase your eidolon&rsquo;s proficiencies.</p>"}

You can cast arcane spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare one 1st-level spell and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (page 5). Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a magus, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, shown in Table 1–2: Magus Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 447 of the Core Rulebook.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"> When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell’s level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn’t use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a magus. For example, as a 1st-level magus, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level magus, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Spellbook</strong></h3>\n<p>Every arcane spell has a written version, usually recorded in a spellbook. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less (as detailed on page 291 of the Core Rulebook), which you receive for free and must study to prepare your spells each day. The spellbook contains your choice of eight arcane cantrips and four 1st-level arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. Your spellbook’s form and name are up to you. It might be anything from a sturdy book with a secure latch entitled <em>Theses on the Stratagems of Supernatural Warfare</em> to a tattered pamphlet with your name scrawled on the cover.</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, you add two more arcane spells to your spellbook, of any level of spell you can cast. You can also use the Arcana skill to add other spells that you find in your adventures, as described on page 241 of the Core Rulebook.</p>\n<p>If you have a spellbook from multiple sources (such as being a magus with Wizard Dedication), you can use the same spellbook for all your spells.</p>\n<table style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

Battle spells are magus-specific spells created for combat. They’re a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to study your spellbook.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don’t require spell slots, nor can you cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points. The full rules are on page 300 of the Core Rulebook.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Striking Spell</h2>\n<p>You’ve learned the fundamental magus technique that lets you combine magic and martial attacks together. You gain the Striking Spell metamagic action. From start to finish, using the effects of Striking Spell is a three-step process. First, you use the Striking Spell free action. Second, you Cast a Spell into your body or weapon, using Striking Spell’s metamagical properties. And third, you Strike with that weapon or your unarmed attack and discharge the spell at your target.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">STRIKING SPELL SPECIFICS</span></p>\n<p>The rules you normally need for Striking Spell are in its stat block. This sidebar clarifies some special circumstances.</p>\n<p>The spell’s effect is the same as it would’ve been when you cast it, except that it targets only the target you hit with your Strike, even if it could potentially target or affect more than one creature or object.</p>\n<p><strong>Ancillary Effects</strong>: It still has any non-targeted effects that might affect creatures other than the target, and any ongoing effects starting from the moment you hit with the Strike. For example, acid splash would still deal its splash damage to creatures other than the target, tanglefoot’s penalty would last for its normal duration, and vampiric touch still gives you temporary Hit Points. The spell takes effect after the Strike deals damage; if the Strike has other special effects, the GM determines whether they happen before or after the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiple Targets</strong>: Some feats let you discharge your spell against more than one target. In these cases, each of those creatures gets its normal defense against the spell (such as a saving throw) and any non-targeted effects that would affect other creatures apply only once, using the worst effect if the effects would be different. For example, hitting multiple creatures with acid splash in this way couldn’t cause a creature to take the splash damage more than once.</p>\n<p><strong>Invalid Target</strong>: If the target you hit wouldn’t be a valid target for the spell, the spell is still expended but doesn’t affect the target.</p>\n<p><strong>Variable Actions</strong>: Some spells have different effects based on the number of actions you spend to cast them; in such cases, the number of actions you actually spent to Cast the Spell determines the effect for Striking Spell.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Magus Synthesis</h2>\n<p>Each magus uses Striking Spell to blend magic with their preferred fighting style and weapon. This particular combination of styles is your magus synthesis. The syntheses presented in this book are as follows.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Shooting Star</strong></span></p>\n<p>A typical magus must retain a physical connection to their weapon to discharge a Striking Spell, but you can extend your magic further to use ranged weapons.</p>\n<p>You can place a spell in a ranged or thrown weapon when using Striking Spell and discharge the spell if you hit with a ranged Strike. If the weapon uses ammunition, the magic is delivered through that ammunition. The spell has its effect on a hit only if the target is in range of the stored spell. For instance, if you hit with a ranged attack at 30 feet, you could trigger the stored spell if it had a range of 30 feet, but not if it had a range of 15 feet or touch.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Slide Casting</strong></span></p>\n<p>You capture a portion of your spell’s magic to forcefully propel yourself while storing a spell. Each magus chooses how they do this, such as propelling themself with telekinesis or filling their body with magical speed.</p>\n<p>After you use Striking Spell and start Casting a Spell that takes 1 action or more to cast, you can Stride or Step as part of that Cast a Spell activity. You choose whether to move before or after the other parts of Casting the Spell. Disrupting this movement doesn’t disrupt the spell, and disrupting the spell doesn’t disrupt the movement. You can Stride or Step only if you’re storing your spell in a one-handed weapon or your body, and only if you have your other hand free.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Sustaining Steel</strong></span></p>\n<p>The clamor and carnage of battle call to you. The process of channeling your arcane power into a large and dangerous weapon fills your body with extra vitality.</p>\n<p>If you use Striking Spell to store a spell in a two-handed weapon, when you finish Casting the Spell you gain temporary Hit Points equal to either the twice spell’s level if you used a spell slot, or its level if your spell didn’t use a spell slot (such as a cantrip or focus spell). These temporary HP last until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Magus Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a magus class feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you’re already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for&nbsp;Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and martial weapons increase to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You can inflict greater injuries with your favored weapons. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you’re an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and 4 if you’re legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Alertness<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Resolve<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Expert Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Your understanding of magic improves, making your spells harder to resist. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Medium Armor Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You’ve learned to defend yourself better against attacks. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple and martial weapons increase to master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you’re an expert, 6 if you’re a master, and 8 if you’re legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Juggernaut<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to a wide range of ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Medium Armor Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill with light and medium armor improves, increasing your ability to avoid blows. Your proficiency ranks for light and medium armor, as well as for unarmed defense, increase to master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Master Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You fortify your spells with masterful prowess. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Double Spellstrike<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You can extend the magic of spells you store with Striking Spell. The first time you discharge a spell with Striking Spell, you retain an echo of the spell, keeping it stored in your body or weapon. You get the full effects of discharging it, but the spell remains stored in the weapon to be used one more time. If you hit a second time while the spell is still stored, you can discharge the spell again, fully expending it this time. This second effect is somewhat weaker than the original. You use a degree of success one worse than you rolled for a spell attack roll, or the target uses a degree of success one better than the result of their saving throw. If this Strike is a critical hit, the spell has its normal effects based on the result of the spell attack roll or saving throw, rather than an increased effect.</p>","_id":"8eAXQqUETQdVAPjt"}
